# Coin Jump

Help the Godot-branded coin get to the green platform.

To do this, hold Space to power up for a flick, or use Left/Right/A/D to change the direction you are looking in.

Note that you can only land on heads (as in Godot Heads) on blue platforms, and only land on tails on gray platforms. Failing to fall on the proper side or falling out will result in you being returned to the last place you were.
